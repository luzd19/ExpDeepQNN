# Deep quantum neural networks equipped with backpropagation on a superconducting processor


In our work [Deep quantum neural networks equipped with backpropagation on a superconducting processor](https://arxiv.org/abs/), we experimentally demonstrate the training of deep quantum neural networks for several tasks on a superconducting processor.
Here, we provide the codes for numerical simulations, data for experimental results and numerical results, and the codes for plotting the figures in our paper.
